# ARXIVE – Smart Contract Lifecycle Management Suite

ARXIVE is a modern Web3 developer suite designed to manage the full lifecycle of smart contracts. It enables seamless contract creation, deployment, monitoring, and archival in one unified platform. Built with support for Ethereum and Aptos networks, ARXIVE simplifies how developers interact with smart contracts and helps reduce blockchain bloat through efficient archival and zero-knowledge proof-backed validation.

---

## Overview

With growing on-chain congestion and storage inefficiencies, ARXIVE introduces a developer-centric contract lifecycle engine that combines:

- A powerful smart contract code editor
- Pre-audited templates across multiple categories (NFT, DAO, Token, Gaming, DeFi)
- Real-time contract deployment with logs and gas usage insights
- On-demand archival of unused contracts via IPFS
- zk-SNARK proof system for verified archival
- Live analytics for smart contract performance and history

ARXIVE empowers developers and teams to scale decentralized infrastructure without sacrificing transparency or cost-efficiency.

## Features

- Smart Contract Editor with Solidity syntax highlighting and real-time error feedback
- Instant Compile and Deploy to Aptos
- Contract Hub with 45+ pre-built contract templates
- IPFS-based contract archiving with Proof-of-Archival
- Multi-wallet integration: Petra, Pontem (Aptos)
- Real-time event logs and deployment analytics
- ZK verification engine for provable off-chain archival 
- Dashboard with performance summaries, deployment history, and verification success rate
- Searchable contract templates categorized by use case

cd arxive
2. Install frontend dependencies
bash
cd frontend
npm install
3. Run the development server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
Usage
Use the dashboard to view active contracts, analytics, gas usage, and deployment logs

Visit the “Contract Hub” to browse and deploy from pre-audited templates

Write your own Solidity code in the code editor and deploy instantly

Archive unused contracts via IPFS and track proof-of-archival on-chain

Switch between networks (Aptos / Ethereum) and wallets easily
