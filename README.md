ARXIVE is a modern Web3 developer suite designed to manage the full lifecycle of smart contracts. It enables seamless contract creation, deployment, monitoring, and archival in one unified platform. Built with support for Aptos networks, ARXIVE simplifies how developers interact with smart contracts and helps reduce blockchain bloat through efficient archival and zero-knowledge proof-backed validation.

## Overview

With growing on-chain congestion and storage inefficiencies, ARXIVE introduces a developer-centric contract lifecycle engine that combines:

- A powerful smart contract code editor
- Pre-audited templates across multiple categories (NFT, DAO, Token, Gaming, DeFi)
- Real-time contract deployment with logs and gas usage insights
- On-demand archival of unused contracts via IPFS
- zk-SNARK proof system for verified archival
- Live analytics for smart contract performance and history

ARXIVE empowers developers and teams to scale decentralized infrastructure without sacrificing transparency or cost-efficiency.
